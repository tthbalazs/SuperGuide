The TVGuide View Controller uses a collectionView with a custom layout to present the TV Guide data. Unfortunately a flow layout won't allow scrolling in both horizontal and vertical directions, so we need to create it manually.

Improvements can be made by also showing the section headers with a different z index as the program cells, and tiling the program cells by program duration.
